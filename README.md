Code and Documentation for The Lam Research Challenge 

The Lam Research Challenge is a nationwide advanced systems engineering competition Organized by T-works

The goal of this project is to design and build a system that captures the outer
contour of any object and exports it as a DXF file for foam board cutting. This system
will use a camera and light-based shadow detection method, and the software will
include options for contour optimization and nesting on a fixed canvas.

Team is working on Problem Statement 3

## Problem Statement 03 :Shadow Contour Capture and Export System for Foam Board Applications

**Objective** - To create a proof of concept for a shadow-based contour capture system,
incorporating image processing to detect, optimize, and export object contours for
foam board cutting. The final export format will be DXF, scaled 1:1, to be used directly
in manufacturing.
